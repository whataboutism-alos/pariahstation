Remember, while we are legally mandated by Commonwealths law to avoid direct discouraging employees from joining a union, wouldn't you rather spend that would-be union due on eating better? Studies show healthier diets lead to more fulfillment at work!
Remember, tickets & food to the Toolbox Tournament aren't cheap. That money in union dues you'd be paying every year could sure go a long way.
Why turn against your good ol' employer Nanotrasen when you can just climb the ranks instead? Equal opportunity for every employee! See, you feel pretty silly considering a union now huh?
Nanotrasen's open door policy is designed to help you feel comfortable taking up issues to your assigned head of staff. It's hard for us to maintain this when they're incapacitated.
